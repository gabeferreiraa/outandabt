# Out&Abt 👋

Welcome to **Out&Abt** - a React Native app built with Expo by the out&abt team.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/go) on your iOS or Android device (for testing on a real device)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabeferreiraa/outandabt.git
cd outandabout
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npx expo start
```

### 4. Run the app

After starting the development server, you'll see a QR code in your terminal. You have several options:

#### 4a running on personal ios device

- **On your phone**: Download the [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/go) and scan the QR code

#### 4b running on ios simulator (Xcode required)

- **iOS Simulator**: Press `i` in the terminal (macOS only, requires Xcode)

## Project Structure

- **app/** - Main application code with file-based routing
- **assets/** - Images, fonts, and other static files

Changes you make will automatically reload in the app.

## Useful Commands

- `npx expo start` - Start the development server
- `npx expo start --clear` - Start with cleared cache
- `npm run reset-project` - Reset to a blank project (removes starter code)
